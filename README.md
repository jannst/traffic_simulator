# Traffic siulator 
The traffic simulator project was a project I did for university in the course of artificial intelligence. The idea is to manage traffic lights at multiple street crossings using a constraint solver. The UI for this project is designed using React JS, along with some HTML and CSS. To run the project, simply execute npm run start.
